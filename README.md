# Phase 3 Project: Areest Prediction
## Business Understanding
A Terry stop is a police procedure that permits law enforcement officers to briefly detain an individual based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Terry Stops are controversial because they give police a wider scope of authority or freedom to make decisions which may lead to wrongful arrests. If most stops donâ€™t lead to arrests, it raises questions about whether they are fair or effective, a concern to policy makers and civil rights organizations.
The main objective of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a Terry Stop conducted by the Seattle Police Department will result in an arrest or not.
